# Linked List
Created a linked list in Python to be tested against different sets of code, ultimately testing the constructs of the linked list. Each test objective was to produce an output that matched the output from its corresponding text file.

I encourage you to run the test files on my linkedlist python code and cross reference the results with the output text files.
