# Linked List
# Objectives<br>
**1. Create a linked list in Python.**<br>
> Linked list must be fully functional with no errors.<br>

**2. Pass each test through the linked list.**<br>
> Every output should match the expected output from its corresponding text file.
<br>

*Note*: This is simply a demonstration of elementary Python abilities.<br>
I encourage you to please run the test files on my linkedlist python code and cross reference the results with their respective output text file.
